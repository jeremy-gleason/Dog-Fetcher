# Dog-Fetcher

Dog Fetcher is a web application that allows users to dynamically request images of their favorite dog breeds. It's built with JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS, and uses asynchronous API calls to return matching images.

## Details

Using asynchronous JavaScript implemented with promises, the application fetches data from [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo/) via an API call,
which responds with the URL of a matching dog image. Dog Fetcher then displays the retrieved image to the user by updating the DOM.

Dog Fetcher is hosted on Github Pages. To use it [click here](https://jeremy-gleason.github.io/Dog-Fetcher).
